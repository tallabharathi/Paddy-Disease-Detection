# Paddy Leaf Disease Detection using CNN
This project identifies diseases in paddy leaves using MobileNet and deep learning.
A deep learning-based project that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect and classify diseases in paddy leaves from images. Built with Python, Flask, and MobileNetV3, it helps farmers identify crop diseases early for better yield and management.
